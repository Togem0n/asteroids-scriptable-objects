### What I implement:

- Scriptable events: a health potion that allows player to pick up
- Asteroid Destoryer

### Where are they:

- Scriptable event:
  - The events part confuses me a lot so I rewrite it after following the original code and some tutorials. The scripts I made can be found under folder "**./Scripts/Assignment**", I also modify "**Hull.cs**" to implement this feature.
- Asteroid Destroyer:
  - I didn't add new scripts for this part, only modifying the original scripts (**Asteroid.cs, AsteroidDestroyer.cs, AsteroidSet.cs, AsteroidSpawner.cs**)
